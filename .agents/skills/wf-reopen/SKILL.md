# /wf-reopen: go back to an earlier stage

## Steps

1. Work out the stage and the reason from what the user wrote; ask for the reason if there is
   none. It is recorded in the entry's history, so make it one plain sentence about what was
   wrong.
2. Run `bin/wf reopen <stage> --reason "<reason>"`. If it refuses, tell the user what it said and
   stop.
3. In the reopened stage's document, add (or extend) a `## Revisions` section at its end with a
   dated paragraph: what is being changed, and why. Fill in what actually changed as the revision
   is made.
4. Commit `workflow.json` and the document ("Reopen the <stage> of <slug>: <reason>").
5. Reply with the reopened stage's skill. Every later stage will be approved again on the way
   forward.
