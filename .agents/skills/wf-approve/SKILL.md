# /wf-approve: approve the current stage

The user has read the stage's work and accepts it. Their invoking this skill is the approval; it
is never given on their behalf.

## Steps

1. Run `bin/wf status` and say which stage of which entry is being approved.
2. If the stage's document, or anything the stage changed, is uncommitted, show the user what is
   uncommitted and ask whether to commit it as part of the approval. Do not commit work the user
   has not seen.
3. Run `bin/wf approve`. If it refuses, report each problem it lists and stop: the stage is not
   done. Do not fix the problems in the same breath; the user decides what happens next.
4. Commit what `wf` changed (`workflow.json`, and `.workflow/active` when the entry is finished)
   as "Approve the <stage> of <slug>".
5. Reply with the next stage and its skill. When the entry is done, say so, and that the branch
   can be merged once `bin/wf check --merge` passes.
