# /wf-start: open an entry

## Steps

1. Work out the slug (lowercase words joined by hyphens, named after the idea), the kind, a title,
   and any entry it revises from what the user wrote. Ask if the kind is unclear: a **feature**
   needs mathematics worked out; a **decision** is an argued position; a **chore** is a port or
   a refactor with no new mathematics or design.
2. If the current branch is `main`, make a branch for the entry first (`git switch -c <slug>`),
   unless your environment names the branch to work on.
3. Run `bin/wf start <slug> --kind <kind> --title "<Title>"`, adding `--revises <slug>,...` when
   it changes the story of finished entries. If it refuses, tell the user what it said and stop.
4. Replace the `[!TODO]` in `site/content/archive/<slug>/index.md` with a paragraph saying what
   the entry sets out to do and why, from what the user said. Ask for what is missing rather than
   inventing it.
5. Commit the entry folder and `.workflow/active` ("Start <slug>: <title>").
6. Reply with the first stage's skill (`bin/wf status` names it). Do not start that stage until
   the user invokes it.
